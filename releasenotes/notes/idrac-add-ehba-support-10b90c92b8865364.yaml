    Fixes the virtual disks creation by changing PERC H740P controller
    mode from `Enhanced HBA` to `RAID` in delete_configuration clean
    step.
    PERC H740P controllers supports RAID mode and Enhanced HBA mode.
    When the controller is in Enhanced HBA, it creates single disk
    RAID0 virtual disks of NON-RAID physical disks.
    Hence the request for VD creation with supported RAID
    fails due to no available physical disk.
    This patch converts the PERC H740P RAID controllers to RAID mode
    if enhanced HBA mode found enabled
