    When Ironic configures the BootSourceOverrideTarget setting via Redfish,
    on Supermicro BMCs it must always configure BootSourceOverrideEnabled or
    that will revert to default (Once) on the BMC, see `story 2008547
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008547>`_ for details.
    This is different than what is currently implemented for other BMCs in
    which the BootSourceOverrideEnabled is not configured if it matches the
    current setting (see `story 2007355
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007355>`_).

    This requires that node.properties['vendor'] be 'supermicro' which will
    be set by Ironic from the Redfish system response or can be set
    manually.
