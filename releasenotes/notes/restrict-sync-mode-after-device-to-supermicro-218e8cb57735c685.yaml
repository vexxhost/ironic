    The fix for story
    `2008252 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008252>`_ synced
    the boot mode after changing the boot device because Supermicro nodes
    reset the boot mode if not included in the boot device set. However this
    can cause a problem on Dell nodes when changing the mode uefi->bios or
    bios->uefi, see `story 2008712
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008712>`_ for details.
    Restrict the syncing of the boot mode to Supermicro.
