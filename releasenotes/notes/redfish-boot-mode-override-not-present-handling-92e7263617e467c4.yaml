    Adds handling of Redfish BMC's which lack a ``BootSourceOverrideMode``
    flag, such that it is no longer a fatal error for a deployment if the BMC
    does not support this field. This most common on BMCs which feature only
    a partial implementation of the ``ComputerSystem`` resource ``boot``,
    but may also be observable on some older generations of BMCs which
    recieved updates to have partial Redfish support.
